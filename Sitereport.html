		<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
		<!-- a heading name introduction-->
		<p>A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase our work and let others know about ourself. It’s like an evergreen platform for our projects, case studies, and information about us. In addition, it’s one of the best ways to express our personality, experience, and capabilities.Having our own website means customers are always able to find us and if interested, reach us. If we don’t have an online presence nowadays, we are behind the times. A portfolio is a great way for photographers, designers, developers and a wide range of artists to present their work online. It lets us reflect our identity through our works – photos, graphic design, sketches, etc (Linda ,Ragaine 2021).</p><hr>

		<h2>Experience</h2><br> 
		<!-- a heading name experience-->
		<p>From the beginnng of the term-I we had been learning basics of web development.Under it were going through html and css basics. Also a standard format of designing.Also i get to know about github its uses.Then it was quite easier to create github account and make a repositories.In github content we learned to clone,push,pull,commit and others.Also commandline was also quite interesting to learn.To make directory ,change directory and few more.We used different html tags like html, head, body, title, headings(h1 to h6), paragraph(p), anchor(a), div, font, span, table, tr, td, ul li, b, u etc firstly.Also learned to use css properties like font-size, font-family, color, background, margins,paddings, text-align, font-weight, border-radius, box-shadow, list-style,text-decoration etc.Then we get to know about box models, google fonts,animations,display properties etc.We also learn to make form and its uses.Among all we went to responsive web designing using media queries.Later on grid layout came to be the most exciting and useful topic.In this assignment i tried to use all the things that i learned in this term.While doing this assignment i need to face manyy ups and downs like getting errors.Actually get to know that errors are the closest friends.I learned many things from the error.To solve the error i read books,went through videos ,google.In the mid of my assignment i also got a ransomware attack in my pc and had to work hard in many aspects.However,if we had keen interest nothing could push away.I tried many way and started again from the beginning ad did my assignment.Get to know that web development is not that tough only thing that make it tough is lack of practise.
